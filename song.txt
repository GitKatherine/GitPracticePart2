I just can't get you out of my head
Boy, your loving is all I think about
I just can't get you out of my head
Boy, it's more than I dare to think about

I just can't get you out of my head
Boy, your loving is all I think about
I just can't get you out of my head
Boy, it's more than I dare to think about

Every night, every day
Just to be there in your arms
Won't you stay? Won't you lay?
Stay forever and ever and ever and ever
